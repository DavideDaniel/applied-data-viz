#### Course Purpose & Goals

This course is all about data visualization with React.

We will have an ES2017 primer to build upon the current ES2016 standard, focusing on where we will use it in project work. We will also cover state management & immutability, concepts and implementation. We'll cover testing in the React ecosystem. We will learn how to create visual elements from Hack Oregon data sources, how to use React's lifecycle methods, and how to leverage D3 within components in a modular and performant way.

For a final project each student will create a React visualization web app, with React Redux, optionally using React specific Javascript libraries. All components we build in class, once tested & reviewed will be open-sourced.

##### Prerequisites
* Experience with Javascript
* Familiarity with React
* Familiarity with data visualization

##### Computing and Technical Environment

***Laptop***
* Multiple Cores: 2 - 4
* Memory: 4GB min.  8GB recommended
* OS (Linux, Windows, MacOS)

##### Please install the following software prior to our first class:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org) or [Node w/ NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

#### Course Outline
Every week we will be covering material planned for the week, and reviewing any materials from the previous week.

There will be weekly assignments based on the material covered that week due over the weekend and to be reviewed in class on Mondays.
Midway through  the course we'll start applying what we're learning towards building data visualization components.

For final projects, teams of 2 will work together on specs from the current season of Hack Oregon projects or platform. If these components satisfy requirements & code review, they will be open sourced as part of Hack Oregon's component library.
